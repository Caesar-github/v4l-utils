-add support for setting / getting the number of read buffers

-add code to v4l2_read to not return frames more then say 5 seconds old

-add support for libv4l1 for non pure capture (combined capture and overlay)
 devices so that atleast CGMBUF emulation (but no conversion, as thats
 impossible for overlays) can be done, so that it will no longer be
 necessary to implement CGMBUF in the kernel for each driver.

-take the possibility of pitch != width into account everywhere


-make updating of parameters happen based on time elapsed rather then
 frames

-add fake flip controls on devices where we are already limiting the
 formats which can be set

-add reverse cropping (adding black borders) to get from 320x232 ->
 320x240, for zc3xx webcams with a broken (last row of jpeg blocks missing)
 320x240 mode

-add software auto exposure (for spca561 cams)

-change video processing to use a per component lookup table for easy combining of
 of different effects in 1 pass

-add gamma correction video processing
