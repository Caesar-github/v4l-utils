libv4l (0.5.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Kees Cook ]
  * Rename lib* to lib*-0: the major ABI number should be reflected in the
    binary package names.
  * Drop .dirs files: they are redundant (i.e. only needed for creating empty
    directories).
  * Remove the static files from *-dev and the rules file.  Building
    static libraries is not really a good idea, since it allows for copies of
    the code to leak everywhere, which makes security updates a pain, etc.
    Unless they are explicitly required, I strongly recommend dropping them.
  * Correct the clean/unpatch rule combo: the build must clean first, then
    unpatch.
  * Added .symbols files to track the change of ABI over time.

  [ Loic Minier ]
  * Merge above changes by Kees Cook; reworded his description as a changelog.
  * Add Kees Cook and myself as uploaders.
  * Add ${misc:Depends} to all packages as recommended in debhelper >= 5 mode
    and add ${shlibs:Depends} to -dev packages which sneak extra deps if they
    start shipping binaries.
  * Wrap build-deps and deps to get cleaner diffs when we change them.
  * Remove boilerplate from rules.
  * Add clean-patched to .PHONY; NB: the current clean-patched isn't -j2 safe.
